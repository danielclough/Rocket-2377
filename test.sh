Perhaps related [Built-in Limits](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/data/struct.Limits.html#built-in-limits).\n\nIt seems that the type `TempFile` should always involve a 1MB limit, but it can accept 2MB from `python requsts`.\n\nThe greatest problem for reconciling my results with the OP is that `curl` accepts a smaller filesize, and OP had it working with `curl` but not `python requests`.\n\n' >> README.md
