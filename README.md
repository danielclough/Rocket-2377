# Rocket Issue #2377
I think this issue may be caused by the difference between `entire data-based form` and `JSON data and form` payloads.

This file is generated by `test.sh` to demonstrate inconsistent/unintuitive filesize requirements. 
Full logs can be found in `troubleshooting.md`.

## 3 filesizes

## Try small file with python

```
reported size: 2096373
stat size: 2096373
```

## Try large file with python

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    assert r.text == os.path.getsize(file), 'different file size due to response being html'

```

## Try with small file with curl

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
