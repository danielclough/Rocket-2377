# Rocket Issue #2377
This file is generated by `test.sh` to demonstrate unintuitive filesize requirements for `curl` vs `python requests`. Perhaps related [Built-in Limits](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/data/struct.Limits.html#built-in-limits).

It seems that the type `TempFile` should always involve a 1MB limit, but it can accept 2MB from `python requsts`.

The greatest problem for reconciling my results with the OP is that `curl` accepts a smaller filesize, and OP had it working with `curl` but not `python requests`.


Full logs can be found in [troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/danielclough/Rocket-2377/blob/main/troubleshooting.md).
